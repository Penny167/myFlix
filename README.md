# myFLix

myFLix is a complete web application (client-side and server-side) built using the MERN stack. It provides users with access to information about different movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to register, update their registration details, perform searches on the information held in the database and create lists of their favorite movies. 

A full table of available API endpoints is provided in the documentation file.

The project to build myFLix is split into two parts, relating to the server and client sides respectively. Part one consists of a REST API that interacts with a non-relational database storing the movie and user information. Part two is the user interface created using REACT.

# Built with

The application has been developed using node.js.

Developer skills and technologies involved in builing the application include:

- Creation of a REST API using the Express framework
- Application of business logic using Mongoose schema and models
- Creation of a non-relational database in MongoDB
- Application of user authentication using Passport and Json Web Tokens
- Creation of a user interface using REACT

A full list of dependencies is contained within the package.json file.

The application is hosted on Heroku, with the database hosted on MongoDB Atlas.
